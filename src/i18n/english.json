    "introduce": "If we want a computer to perform calculations, we need to establish logical relationships through switching circuits. The connection between switching circuits and logic was first established by Claude Elwood Shannon (hereafter referred to as 'Shannon'). In 1937, in his master's thesis at MIT, Shannon concluded that electronic switches could be connected in various ways to perform any logical function. This is considered one of the most influential master's theses in history. In his thesis, Shannon demonstrated that switches could be combined in different ways to execute simple logical operations, and these combinations of switches are called logic gates. The most basic logic gates that make up a computer are AND, OR, and NOT gates. Let's now take a closer look at these logic gates...",
